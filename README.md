# Building an API for Your Raspbery Pi Zero W

This is an example application for creating an API for the Raspberry Pi Zero W to control four LEDs, each connected to its own GPIO.

Having an API for our hardware allows us to remotely control and/or monitor our hardware with code. With this power, we can even build apps on top of our hardware!
